# Chrome-history-reader

## Description
I built this program to go through one's chrome browsing history which is a json file and I specifically wanted to extract the links of all the youtube videos I had watched. However, I have tried to make it more generalised with regards to reading reading the json file.

## Installation 
```shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/TheBombre/chrome-history-reader.git
$ cd chrome-history-reader
$ python3 main.py # python on windows
```
